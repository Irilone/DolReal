# Project: Dagar om Lagar 2025

## Project Overview

This project is a web application for the "Dagar om Lagar 2025" event. It is built using React, TypeScript, and Next.js, with Tailwind CSS for styling. The application provides information about the event, including a program schedule, and features a knowledge graph integration with InfraNodus and live video streams from YouTube. It also includes internationalization support using `i18next`.

The main user interface is a single page with a header, a knowledge graph navigator, a live stream section, a program schedule, and a footer. There is also an alternative split-view layout for an immersive experience with the knowledge graph and a video stream.

## Key Technologies

*   **Framework:** Next.js 15
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **UI Library:** React
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
*   **Internationalization:** i18next
*   **Knowledge Graph:** InfraNodus
*   **Video Streaming:** YouTube

## File Structure

*   `october/dol.tsx`: The main React component for the application.
*   `october/alt-dol.tsx`: An alternative split-view layout for the application.
*   `october/dol-2.tsx`: A duplicate of `dol.tsx` with some extra content. This file seems redundant and could be cleaned up.
*   `october/index.html`: The main HTML file, which is currently empty. The content is likely generated by Next.js.
*   `october/style.css`: The main stylesheet, which is likely used for global styles.
*   `october/scripts.js`: A JavaScript file, which is currently empty.

## Building and Running

There are no explicit build or run commands in the files. However, based on the use of Next.js, the following commands are likely to be used:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start the production server
npm run start
```

**TODO:** Verify these commands and update this section if necessary.
