# Node Operator Quick Start

## Overview
This guide explains how to operate one of the four streaming nodes for the Dagar om Lagar 2025 event.

## Pre-Event Checklist (T-1 hour)

*   [ ] **Verify Internet Connection:** Run a speed test to ensure you have at least 25 Mbps upload speed.
*   [ ] **Test OBS Scenes:** Open OBS and cycle through all your scenes to ensure they are working correctly.
*   [ ] **Confirm YouTube Stream Key:** Double-check that the stream key in the OBS Multi-RTMP plugin matches the one for your assigned YouTube channel.
*   [ ] **Check Audio Levels:** Speak into your microphone and check the audio levels in the OBS audio mixer. The levels should be in the yellow range, not peaking into the red.
*   [ ] **Verify Camera Feed:** Ensure your camera is on and the video feed is appearing correctly in OBS.

## Day 1 (November 6th)

All four nodes are active on Day 1:

*   Nodväst
*   Nodsyd
*   Nodöst
*   Nodmidd

## Day 2 (November 7th)

Only the **Nodväst** node is active on Day 2. All other nodes are on standby.

## During the Event

*   **Monitor Bitrate:** Keep an eye on the bitrate in the OBS status bar. It should remain stable and close to your target bitrate (6000 Kbps).
*   **Watch YouTube Studio Health:** Open the YouTube Studio for your stream and monitor the stream health indicator. It should be green.
*   **Backup:** If your internet connection drops, be prepared to switch to a pre-recorded video file to keep the stream going.

## Post-Event

*   **Export Recordings:** If you recorded the stream locally, export the recordings from OBS.
*   **Archive Stream Keys:** Store the stream keys in a safe place for future reference.
*   **Generate Analytics Report:** Go to the YouTube Studio and generate an analytics report for your stream.
