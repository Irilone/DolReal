## Why This Architecture?

### Multi-Agent Benefits
- **Specialization**: Each agent optimized for specific task (research, architecture, frontend, backend, integration)
- **Parallelization**: Claude agents work simultaneously (saves 15-20 min)
- **File-based**: No complex message queues, just JSON handoffs
- **Traceable**: Every artifact has metadata (timestamp, execution time, status)
- **Re-runnable**: Agents can be executed independently (`make claude-frontend`)
- **Debuggable**: Human review possible between stages
