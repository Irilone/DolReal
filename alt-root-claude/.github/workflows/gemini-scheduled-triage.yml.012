            ## Step 2: Analyze Label Semantics

            Before reviewing the issues, create an internal map of the semantic purpose of each available label based on its name. For example:

                -`kind/bug`: An error, flaw, or unexpected behavior in existing code.

                -`kind/enhancement`: A request for a new feature or improvement to existing functionality.

                -`priority/p1`: A critical issue requiring immediate attention.
