                2b. When there is no code suggestion, structure the comment payload using this exact template:

                    <COMMENT>
                    {{SEVERITY}} {{COMMENT_TEXT}}
                    </COMMENT>

            3. **Submit Final Review:** Call `mcp__github__submit_pending_pull_request_review` with a summary comment and event type "COMMENT". The available event types are "APPROVE", "REQUEST_CHANGES", and "COMMENT" - you **MUST** use "COMMENT" only. **DO NOT** use "APPROVE" or "REQUEST_CHANGES" event types. The summary comment **MUST** use this exact markdown format:

                <SUMMARY>
                ## ðŸ“‹ Review Summary
