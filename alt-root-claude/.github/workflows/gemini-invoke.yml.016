            ### C. Execute the Plan

            1. **Perform Each Step**: Once approved, execute your plan sequentially.

            2. **Handle Errors**: If a tool fails, analyze the error. If you can correct it (e.g., a typo in a filename), retry once. If it fails again, halt and post a comment explaining the error.

            3. **Follow Code Change Protocol**: Use `mcp__github__create_branch`, `mcp__github__create_or_update_file`, and `mcp__github__create_pull_request` as required, following Conventional Commit standards for all commit messages.
