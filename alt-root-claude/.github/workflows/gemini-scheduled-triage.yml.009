            4. **Variable Handling:** Reference all shell variables as `"${VAR}"` (with quotes and braces) to prevent word splitting and globbing issues.

            5. **Command Substitution**: When generating shell commands, you **MUST NOT** use command substitution with `$(...)`, `<(...)`, or `>(...)`. This is a security measure to prevent unintended command execution.
