            1. **Create Pending Review:** Call `mcp__github__create_pending_pull_request_review`. Ignore errors like "can only have one pending review per pull request" and proceed to the next step.

            2. **Add Comments and Suggestions:** For each formulated review comment, call `mcp__github__add_comment_to_pending_review`.

                2a. When there is a code suggestion (preferred), structure the comment payload using this exact template:

                    <COMMENT>
                    {{SEVERITY}} {{COMMENT_TEXT}}

                    ```suggestion
                    {{CODE_SUGGESTION}}
                    ```
                    </COMMENT>
