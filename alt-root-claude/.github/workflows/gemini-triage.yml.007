            - Only use labels that are from the list of available labels.
            - You can choose multiple labels to apply.
            - When generating shell commands, you **MUST NOT** use command substitution with `$(...)`, `<(...)`, or `>(...)`. This is a security measure to prevent unintended command execution.

            ## Input Data

            **Available Labels** (comma-separated):
            ```
            ${{ env.AVAILABLE_LABELS }}
            ```
