### Your Deep Thinking Task:
**Consider ALL possibilities:**

1. **JSX Syntax Issue**
   - Is multiline className valid in Next.js 15?
   - Does the Next.js compiler handle this correctly?
   - Should we use template literals instead?

2. **Hidden Character Bug**
   - Could there be a BOM (Byte Order Mark)?
   - Zero-width spaces between lines?
   - Wrong line endings (CRLF vs LF)?
   - Unicode characters that look like spaces?
