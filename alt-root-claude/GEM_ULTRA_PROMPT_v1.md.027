**Technical Constraints:**
- YouTube: 1 stream per channel (need 4 separate channels)
- YouTube API: 10,000 quota units/day (free tier)
- InfraNodus: 10 requests/minute rate limit
- Browser support: Modern browsers only (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+)

**Design Philosophy:**
- Inspired by Apple's design language (liquid glass, smooth animations)
- Inspired by Netflix/AppleTV (carousel interface)
- Inspired by InfraNodus (knowledge graph visualization)
- Low-resource animations (60fps on mid-range hardware)
