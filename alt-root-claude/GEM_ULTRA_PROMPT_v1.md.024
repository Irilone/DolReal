**Multi-Step Analysis:**
1. First, understand the complete context
2. Then, identify all issues (not just obvious ones)
3. Next, prioritize by impact and urgency
4. Finally, provide actionable solutions

**Critical Thinking:**
- Challenge assumptions (is Next.js 15 really the best choice?)
- Look for hidden issues (encoding problems, race conditions)
- Consider failure modes (what breaks on event day?)
- Think about maintainability (who fixes bugs post-launch?)
