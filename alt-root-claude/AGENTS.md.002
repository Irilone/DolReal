## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Default to TypeScript ES modules with two-space indentation and rely on Prettier via `trunk check`. Name React components and classes in PascalCase, helpers in camelCase, and generated bundles in kebab-case (`research_bundle.json`, `site_spec.md`). Start interactive `.tsx` files with `'use client';` and order Tailwind classes layout → spacing → color. Centralize shared utilities in `src/lib/` and keep comments focused on non-obvious behavior.

## Testing Guidelines

Jest drives primary suites through `npm test`; augment with `node --test` or Vitest specs under `scripts/__tests__/` to mock Gemini calls and verify file writes. Place component tests beside their sources once stabilized and keep integration fixtures in `tests/`. Always run `trunk check` and `npm test` before opening a PR, capturing logs for any failures.
