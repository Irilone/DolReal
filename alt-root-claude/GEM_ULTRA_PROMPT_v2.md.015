### Your Deep Thinking Analysis:
1. **Is this truly GPU-accelerated?**
   - Check for `will-change` properties
   - Verify `transform3d` usage for GPU layers
   - Are animations causing repaints?

2. **Performance on low-end devices?**
   - Test on 2018 MacBook Air
   - Test on mid-range Android phone
   - Shooting stars disabled < 768px (is this enough?)
