2. **Architecture Assessment**
   - Is Next.js 15 App Router the right choice for this use case?
   - Should we use Server Components more extensively?
   - Is Zustand sufficient or should we use React Query?
   - Are there any critical architectural flaws?

3. **Production Readiness**
   - What's missing from the deployment checklist?
   - Are there any edge cases we haven't considered?
   - What could break on event day (Nov 6-7)?
   - How resilient is this to YouTube API failures?
