2. **Performance Investigation:**
   - What's the actual bundle size impact of all dependencies?
   - Can we reduce JavaScript payload with better code splitting?
   - Are the CSS animations truly GPU-accelerated?
   - What's the real-world performance on 3G/4G networks?

3. **Security Analysis:**
   - Are API keys properly secured (never in client bundles)?
   - Is the YouTube iframe embed vulnerable to clickjacking?
   - Does the InfraNodus integration leak user data?
   - Are there CSRF vulnerabilities in API routes?
