### YouTube Player Notes

- **Single active player constraint**: Only one stream can play at a time (enforced in `useStreamPlayer.ts`)
- **Day 2 logic**: On November 7, 2025, only Nodv√§st stream is active (others disabled but UI unchanged)
- **No autoplay**: User must click play (WCAG compliance + YouTube policy)
- Uses **YouTube IFrame API** loaded via script tag in layout
