## Conference Content Analysis

### Pre-Conference Planning

#### Speaker Abstract Analysis
```
Workflow:
1. Collect all speaker abstracts
2. Generate knowledge graph: "Create a knowledge graph from these conference abstracts"
3. Identify clusters: "Show me the main topical clusters"
4. Find gaps: "What content gaps exist in our program?"
5. Generate recommendations: "Suggest additional speakers or topics"
```
