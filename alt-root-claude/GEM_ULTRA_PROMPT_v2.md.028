### 2. Architecture Validation
**Consider second-order effects:**
- Is Next.js 15 App Router truly necessary for this use case?
- Are we using Server Components effectively?
- Could this be a static site with client-side routing?
- What happens if we need to scale to 1000+ simultaneous viewers?
- What if YouTube API goes down during the event?

### 3. Production Resilience
**Think about failure modes:**
- What breaks if YouTube API rate limits us?
- What if InfraNodus is slow/down?
- What if one stream fails to load?
- How do we handle network issues?
- What's our fallback plan for each failure?
