### 4. November 6-7 Event Day Scenarios
**War game the launch:**
- 1000 viewers join simultaneously - what breaks?
- WiFi is slow/unstable - user experience?
- Mobile users on 4G - load time?
- Screen readers - do they work?
- Browser back button - does routing work?

### 5. Long-term Maintenance
**Think beyond launch:**
- Who maintains this after the event?
- How easy is it to fix bugs?
- Can non-React developers understand the code?
- Is the documentation sufficient?
- What's the technical debt burden?
