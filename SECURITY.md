### Example Report

```
Subject: [SECURITY] XSS Vulnerability in Stream Title Display

Description:
User-supplied stream titles are not properly sanitized before being
rendered in the UI, allowing for potential XSS attacks.

Impact:
An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript that executes when
other users view the stream list.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a stream with title: <script>alert('XSS')</script>
2. View the stream list
3. Alert is triggered

Affected Versions: 2.0.0 - 2.1.5
Suggested Fix: Use DOMPurify or similar sanitization library
```
